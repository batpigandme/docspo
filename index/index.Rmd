# What is this?

A few years back I chanced upon [__studyspo__](https://dataandme.tumblr.com/tagged/studyspo) tumblr, a place where the drudgery of note-taking is celebrated as an art form (or at least that's _my_ interpretation). Here, I hope to collect similar findings in the realm of documentation for programming languages and frameworks.

I'm not yet sure who the target audience is for this (aside from yours truly), or if this document will hold any meaning unto itself. But, for now, I quite literally need a place to keep my notes.

# JavaScript

::: {.status}
__My status:__ I don't know JavaScript, but we travel in some of the same circles. Like, we have enough mutual friends that I could easily get by with a combination of copy and paste and asking for help, but I've never _tried_ to learn it head on. We interact mainly through R packages that wrap JavaScript APIs, which occasionally leads to my looking under the hood to tweak a few things directly.

## Speaking JavaScript

[_Speaking JavaScript_](http://speakingjs.com/) [@speakingjs] wasn't the first thing I found when looking for some sort of crash-course intro to JS for someone (me) who already knows how to program but is looking to become a bit more JavaScript literate, but I wish it had been. Its author, [Axel Rauschmayer](http://dr-axel.de/), has several free, online [JavaScript books](https://exploringjs.com/), all of which he describes in one or two bullets that, along with their titles, give you a sense of who the targeted reader is.

#### Overview in commented code

I'm lifting this whole example that comprises [__An Overview of the Syntax__](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch01.html#_an_overview_of_the_syntax) from the [first chapter](http://speakingjs.com/es5/ch01.html) because I think it's _masterful_:

```{js speaking-js-overview, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
// Two slashes start single-line comments

var x;  // declaring a variable

x = 3 + y;  // assigning a value to the variable `x`

foo(x, y);  // calling function `foo` with parameters `x` and `y`
obj.bar(3);  // calling method `bar` of object `obj`

// A conditional statement
if (x === 0) {  // Is `x` equal to zero?
    x = 123;
}

// Defining function `baz` with parameters `a` and `b`
function baz(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

```

Why am I so obsessed with it? It's _beyond_ parsimonious. In that code block alone, you're introduced to what would elsewhere be several chapters worth of content.^[That's not a bad thing in those contexts, but this is something special.] How to write a comment is always one of the first things I want to know when encountering new syntax, _plus_ it lets you read the commented code that follows. 

You also pick up several pieces of vocabulary, the meanings of which can be inferred from the context and that the author can continue to use without needing to explicitly define them: variable, value, function, object, parameter, method, etc. This is super valuable for getting started, especially since defining these terms can be onerous and abstract. I don't need to know what exactly a method is or how it does what it does, but being able to know that `obj.bar(3);` means a method is being called on an object opens up quite a bit in terms of reading code.  The chapter _does_ go on to define each of these terms, but having that overview means that the definitions can reference other terms without worrying too much about order/sequence.

#### Setting the vibe

I admittedly didn't read the whole preface, but there are pieces of it I think are really well done. [“What You Need to Know About This Book”](http://speakingjs.com/es5/pr02.html#_what_you_need_to_know_about_this_book) gives you the persona/target audience (programmers who know some other language), and what's _not_ covered. And then there's this liberating first sentence to [“Tips for Reading this Book”](http://speakingjs.com/es5/pr02.html#how_to_read):

> The most important tip for learning JavaScript is _don’t get bogged down by the details_.

I honestly think that's one of the hardest things for programmers to do when writing: ignore the edge cases (AKA get bogged down by the details). It's like we write in preemptive defense of someone coming in and pointing out the exceptions. Guess what? They're not who you're writing this for, Susan!

#### My take

I haven't read the whole thing yet (which should be obvious, given my current relationship with JavaScript), and I'll likely add more comments here as I go. That said, I got more out of reading that one chapter (the first) than I did out of reading more in-depth reference pages on similar topics&mdash;I'm glad they all exist, but Speaking JS is fresh (and very for me). 

## ReactJS

### Getting Started

#### The structure is everything

There may not have list agreement, but the options at the top of [React's “Getting Started”](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) [@reactjs] really are pretty darn good: [try React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#try-react), [learn React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react), [staying informed](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#staying-informed), [versioned documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#versioned-documentation), [something missing](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#something-missing). 

```{r react-gettingstarted, fig.alt="Screenshot of https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html showing the aforementioned list of options", fig.cap="Screenshot of Getting Started page for React"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("index", "imgs", "reactjs_getting_started.png"))
```

Maybe I'd kill off “something missing” (from that header menu, not get rid of it on the whole), but it's concise and gives the primary things someone would be looking for in getting-started-style documentation. 

In [Learn React](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html#learn-react) they expressly break things down again:

> * If you prefer to __learn by doing__, start with our [practical tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).  
> * If you prefer to __learn concepts step by step__, start with our [guide to main concepts](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).

You also have the sidebar navigation showing you the other sections, some of which might be what someone was actually looking for when they went to the getting-started page (e.g. [add React to a website](https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html), [create a new React app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html)). I also like the wording of “Main Concepts” (and how prominent it is in the menu)&mdash;most people aren't trying to learn all the things, and it lets you know that this subset probably holds the key concepts you need to get going.

# Sass

::: {.status}
__My status:__ I've been learning Sass over the past few months as I familiarize myself with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and Bootstrap theming^[See [Down the front-end rabbit hole](https://dataand.me/notes/2021-12-26-down-the-front-end-rabbit-hole).]. While I'm by no means an expert, I have a decent sense of how it works at this point.

## Sass blog

I think that, on the whole, the official [Sass-language documentation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation) [@sassdocs2021] is quite good. 
The [Sass blog](https://sass-lang.com/blog) has a structure I like in terms of clear categories/types of posts that are consistent, with obvious target audiences, and calls to action.

Posts titled __“Request for Comment”__, e.g. [Request for Comments: New JS API](https://sass-lang.com/blog/request-for-comments-new-js-api) [@weizenbaum2021a], summarize the key aspects of feature proposals, linking to their full discussions on GitHub. 
It's a nice way of both soliciting feedback for those who don't necessarily want to go through what might be difficult-to-follow threads on GitHub, and creating something to refer back to if/when these proposals are implemented.

Posts announcing live implementations of __release candidates__, e.g. [New JS API Release Candidate is Live](https://sass-lang.com/blog/new-js-api-release-candidate) [@weizenbaum2021b], “give users a chance to kick the tires a bit before we set [a feature] in stone.”
There are clear instructions about how to use the release candidate (including installation instructions, when necessary), and a concluding section on what to expect if/when deprecation time comes around.

A __“Feature Watch”__ post, e.g. [Feature Watch: CSS Imports and CSS Compatibility](https://sass-lang.com/blog/feature-watchcss-imports-and-css-compatibility) [@weizenbaum2018], goes into details about a feature that has gone through the their process of: proposal, tests, and implementation. They're fairly similar to our package-release posts on the tidyverse blog.

Posts __announcing deprecation__, e.g. [LibSass is Deprecated](https://sass-lang.com/blog/libsass-is-deprecated) [@weizenbaum2020], start off with the key points (which makes sense). After that, the key sections are as follows:  

  * Why deprecate?  
  * What does “deprecated” mean?    
  * How do I migrate?  

Other sections are context dependent, but I particularly like that they take the time to reiterate the meaning of the lifecycle stage (i.e. deprecation).

#### My take

The Sass blog is sufficiently sparse (about four posts a year) that it seems followable for heavy language users. It also creates a succinct, structured trail for the developers to point to as users who haven't followed as closely encounter these things in the future.
