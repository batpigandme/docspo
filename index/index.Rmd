# What is this?

A few years back I chanced upon [__studyspo__](https://dataandme.tumblr.com/tagged/studyspo) tumblr, a place where the drudgery of note-taking is celebrated as an art form (or, at least, that's my interpretation). Here, I hope to collect similar findings in the realm of documentation for programming languages and frameworks.

I'm not yet sure who the target audience is for this (aside from yours truly), or if this document will hold any meaning unto itself. But, for now, I quite literally need a place to keep my notes.
